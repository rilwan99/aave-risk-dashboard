# AAVE Risk Dashboard

## Overview
The AAVE Risk Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and monitor the risk associated with AAVE V3 deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This tool provides real-time insights into total borrowed amounts, total supplied, and other vital health metrics to assess the solvency and overall risk of the protocol.

## Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Monitor AAVE V3 metrics in real-time to assess ongoing risk.
- **Health Metrics**: Utilize various indicators including total supply and borrow rates to gauge protocol health.
- **Solvency Checks**: Evaluate the solvency of AAVE V3 through detailed risk assessments.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:
