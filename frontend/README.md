This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables
1. Create a .env file in the /frontend directory.
2. Add the required environment variables as shown below. This includes the base URL for your backend API.
3. Modify the environment variables as necessary. For instance, if you deploy your backend to a cloud service, update the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL with the URL of your deployed service

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
